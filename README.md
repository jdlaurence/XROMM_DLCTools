# xromm
Integrate [XMALab](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/xmalab) and [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut) for high-throughput XROMM

The file Workflow_Instructions.pdf contains a step-by-step walk through of the process. Stay tuned for frequent updates, and please, post any bugs/issues. The default workflow involves training a single network that will analyze videos from both camera planes. If you want to train seperate networks for each camera plane, use the 2Networks Jupyter Notebook.

Special thanks to Ben Knorlein for XMALab and Mackenzie Mathis, Alexander Mathis, Tanmay Nath, and all other DeepLabCut authors/contributers.
