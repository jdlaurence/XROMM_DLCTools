# xromm
Integrate [XMALab](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/xmalab) and [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut) for high-throughput XROMM

[Go to instructions](https://github.com/jdlaurence/xromm/blob/master/instructions.md)

The file Workflow_Instructions.pdf contains an **OUTDATED** step-by-step walk through of the process. I am in the process of updating the instructions.md document to reflect the latest version. The jupyter notebooks are up to date though. Stay tuned. The default workflow involves training a single network that will analyze videos from both camera planes. If you want to train seperate networks for each camera plane, use the 2Networks Jupyter Notebook.

Special thanks to Ben Knorlein for XMALab and Mackenzie Mathis, Alexander Mathis, Tanmay Nath, and all other DeepLabCut authors/contributers.
